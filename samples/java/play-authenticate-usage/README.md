# Play Authenticate sample Java application

By default there is only the UsernamePassword and the OpenID provider enabled, as all other providers need some additional settings that have to be acquired from the according service (Google, Facebook, etc.) - please check the `conf/play.plugins` file to enable more providers and add your data to `conf/play-authenticate/mine.conf`.
